# HRT Cost Calculator

This is a web app that will calculate the cost of HRT.
This calculator provides a guided experience through several screens.

It should ask the user
* what kind of HRT one wants, (E based or T based)
* Which hospital they intend to go
* Offer a selection of medicine
  * anti-androgens first then estrogen for E based
  * testosterone for T based
* The dosage one times per week/month one wishes to take them

Upon which it should provide a price summary where specific values for dosage and medication intervals can be adjusted.
The summary screen should
* include the cost of all required appointments.
* Weekly, Monthly, Yearly and lifetime costs (maybe ask age for this?)

It is a work in Progress.
