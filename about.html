        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is a webApp that seeks to make it easy for the trans and nonbinary community in Singapore to calculate how much it would be to get on HRT in Singapore through the public healthcare system across a single day, month, year and one's lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
        This webApp was made because no one would do it. And no one in the medical establishment would help with its creation. Certainly not my doctors. Inlieu of official data and a medical API, data instead was crowdsourced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data for the HRT calculator was collated from Singapore's trans community in previous years in a spreadsheet. That data was translated into a json file that this webApp uses.
      </p>
      <p>
        No data is collected from this webApp itself as processing is down clientside (in your browser). This may not be true of the host, glitch.me/

        Some effort has been made to make this site accessible but not enough testing has been done with screen readers. I apologise and welcome feedback on this.
